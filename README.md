# Introduction

> commandlinefu.com is the place to record those command-line gems that you return to again and again. That way others can gain from your CLI wisdom and you from theirs too. All commands can be commented on, discussed and voted up or down.

`commandlinefu` is an unofficial cli/repl client for [commandlinefu.com](https://www.commandlinefu.com), written in [golang](https://golang.org/).

This uses both the provided [official api](https://www.commandlinefu.com/site/api) and scrapes the website because the official api does not provide all features present in the website.
